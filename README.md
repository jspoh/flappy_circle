# flappy_circle


Basic flappy bird game but it's a circle instead of a bird. I included a difficulty selection stage so that users can customize their gameplay.
Also, I realised that I could use PySimpleGUI's popups in a pygame window, pretty cool.

May add more walls to show up on the screen at once soon.

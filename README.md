# flappy_circle


Basic flappy bird game but it's a circle instead of a bird. I included a difficulty selection stage so that users can customize their gameplay.
Also, I realised that I could use PySimpleGUI's popups in a pygame window, pretty cool.

Might improve of this if I have nothing better to do:
- Allow more walls that spawn in together
- Change the circle to an actual bird icon
- Increase the speed of the walls coming at the bird as you progress
